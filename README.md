# yon

`yon` is a small utility for writing yes/no prompts in the shell. "yon" stands for **Yes Or No**. 

The included binary is compiled for Linux using [luastatic](https://github.com/ers35/luastatic).

## Usage

    if yon; then
      echo ok
    fi

## TODO

- take options other than y/n
- accept a prompt to display
- decide how to specify exit codes or printed values
